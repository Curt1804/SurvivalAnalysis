# SurvivalAnalysis
Using R, a survival analysis algorithm used to extrapolate a Kaplan-Meier curve and subsequently fit various distributions to it.
I have succesfully extrapolated the KM curve and plotted 8 distributions over it, I would like help removing the confidence intervals so the complete plot with all 8 distributions looks cleaner. I am also curious to use ggplot. Any help would be appriciated!
